A stakeholder in a project is any individual, group, or organization that is affected by, has an interest in, or can influence the project’s outcome.
Stakeholders can be either internal or external to the organization. But they are ultimately an important part in the project execution.
Let me explain the stakholder importance by analysing an example of an IT project in an organisation, say an ERP implementation project.
For a project implementing a new ERP system:
- Sponsor → CFO funding the project.
- Project Manager → oversees implementation.
- IT Team → configures and tests the system.
- Employees → end users who will use the system daily.
- Vendor → software provider.
Regulators → ensure data protection compliance.
Each of them has different levels of influence and interest towards the project:
High influence & high interest → Sponsor, Project Manager.
High interest but lower influence → Employees (users).
High influence but not always direct interest → Regulators.

Here for a visual representation of stakeholder analysis, I am using the following sample data and generate a scatter plot using it.
